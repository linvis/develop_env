My develop environment is based on zsh-tmux-neovim.

This repo try to build an auto-install system to help configure development tool without manual.



## zsh

Use default configuration.

## tmux

* install from source code

* use F12 as prefix key

* enable mouse support

* vi mode key

* tmux restore plugin

  

## neovim

Before neovim, I use vim8.0, but there are some shorts, like not friend with global paste, not easy to install(usually need to remove old version and install latest), no commder hint.

Main plugin I used in neovim

* Gtags instead of cscope, also use ctags in the same
* deoplete instead of YCM(YCM is too difficult to install)
* molokai colorscheme
* LeaderF as file searcher
